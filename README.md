# TikTok Virality and Spotify Streaming Performance

## Overview

This project analyzes whether TikTok engagement is associated with Spotify streaming performance, with a specific focus on comparing older songs (released at least 10 years before 2024) with newer releases. The analysis uses a dataset containing Spotify’s most-streamed songs of 2024, including track metadata, release dates, Spotify stream counts, and TikTok engagement metrics.

The project includes structured data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and statistical modelling using Spearman’s Rank Correlation and log–log linear regression.
